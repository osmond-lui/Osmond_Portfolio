# [Project 4: Android Coding Project - Standing Meditation Tool](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.s.meditation.qi&hl=en_GB&gl=US) 
Completion Date: 11 May 2021

Overview: This app can change your phone into a powerful standing meditation tool for your daily standing meditation/qigong practices. I am a Tai Chi standing meditation practitioner. I have been learning and practicing Tai Chi and standing meditation for almost 2 years. It helps to control my blood pressure and age well. I hope this tool can help you too!

This app has four functions. 
* The first one is a compass. This compass can point out where you need to facing with based on Zi Wu Liu Zhu theory. In the old days, qigong practitioner will change the facing direction according to the time of the day. The reason behind is to match the earth magnetic field with inner body magnet for better Qi/energy cultivation. For example, practitioner will face south at noon time; face north at midnight; face east at 3:00 pm and face west at 9:00 pm. So this app will tell you which direction is better for energy cultivation.
* The second function is a Chinese body clock. It tells the energy focus organ around the clock. It is an essential tool for Qi cultivation.
* The third function is meridian body clock. It shows the meridian flow during the time of the day. Understanding the blood flow of meridian helps to better feel the Qi flowing through your body.
* The fourth function is a singing bowl timer. It helps to overcome meditation struggles. It sets the meditation target and makes you clam.
